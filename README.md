# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo will host a series of DSA problems with their solutions.

* The solutions will be mostly in Javascript or Typescript.

* The problems would be categorized in their own folders. 
    * A detailed analysis of the solution would be added.
* Some of the problems may contain more than one solution.
    * In such scenarios, the solutions would be categorized in sub-folders with seperate analysis for each. 
    * The best case solution would be the last one.
